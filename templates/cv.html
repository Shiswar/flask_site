                        I am self-motivated, quick to learn and enjoy working as part of a team. I am looking to further develop and enhance my skills in the IT industry, specifically in artificial intelligence.
                        My passion towards computing and digital systems pushed me to pursue my career as a developer. 
                        As a strong creative thinker, finding different and effective solutions to problems has always been a strength of mine.   
                        <hr>
                        I am also a competitive hockey player and I currently represent Auckland at the Premier level.
                        My hockey career has trained me to become a confident leader. I have always believed that there is no replacement for hard work, leading by example inspires others to push themselves. 
                        My commitment to my hockey career has always kept me learning and working hard in all areas of my life. 
                        <hr>
                        Other interests of mine include golf, basketball and video gaming.
